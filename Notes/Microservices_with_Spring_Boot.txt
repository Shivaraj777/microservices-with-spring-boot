Microservices:
	 - Microservice is an approach of developing a single application as a suite of multiple small services.
	 - these services communicate with each other with lightweight mechanisms(such as REST APIs).
	 - they are independent and fully automated.
	 
Why Spring Boot:
	 - Spring Boot simplifies the development and deployment of Java application and also microservices.
	 - we can build self contained executable jar files instead of WAR or EAR files
	 - these jar files contain all the resources(libraries, classes, server...) to run a project
	 
Dependency of spring boot project in start.spring.io:
	 - H2 database:
		 - it is an internal memory database used to create spring boot wen applications
		 - does not require installation of mysql applications or servers...
		 
	 - Lombok:
		 - developer tool spring boot dependency
		 - helps us to reduce writing custom boilerplate code like getters/setters.... in POJO class.
		 
	 - Validation:
		 - required for validation of I/O requests
